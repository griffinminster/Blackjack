# Blackjack

A text-based emulation of Blackjack played in JOptionPanes. 
Complete with setting a bankroll, placing a bet, doubling down, and playing against a dealer.
Updates bankroll on wins and losses, and gives option to continue playing.

Coded in Java on the BlueJ Educational IDE

This was the first actual project I made, for a programming class in high school. The code is sloppy (and the file management/directory system even sloppier), but the code runs withot errors.
